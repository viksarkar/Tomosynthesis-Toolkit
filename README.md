# Tomosynthesis-Toolkit
Matlab-based application for applications of digital tomosynthesis in Radiotherapy

This work was done as part of my Ph.D. at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. 

The user guide is in the 'Demo Data' folder. 

If you use any part of this work/repo, all I ask is that you reference the following paper: 

Sarkar, Vikren, Chengyu Shi, and Niko Papanikolaou. "DART, a platform for the creation and registration of cone beam digital tomosynthesis datasets." Australasian physical & engineering sciences in medicine 34.1 (2011): 5-13.
